# **Project Breakdown: "SeasonNotifier"**

#### **Phase 1: Research and Planning**

1. **Define the Scope**
   * List all seasonal events, both Gregorian and regional (like Onam, Eid, etc.).
   * Create a feature list: Seasonal event notifications, recommendations for businesses, etc.
   * Define your target audience: Retailers, event planners, local businesses.
2. **Gather Data Sources**
   * Research APIs for **lunar events** (e.g., Aladhan API for Islamic holidays, local Malayalam calendar sources for Onam, Vishu).
   * Find or build datasets for fixed-date events (like Christmas, Kerala Piravi, etc.).
   * Determine whether any **third-party providers** can give you region-specific data for school schedules, festivals, etc.

#### **Phase 2: Design & Architecture**

1. **Database Schema**

   Design a flexible schema for events, supporting both fixed and dynamic dates.

   You can use **MongoDB** (for easy scalability) or any relational database (like PostgreSQL) for event storage.
2. **API Design**

   * Define the endpoints (as mentioned in our previous discussion).
   * Structure the data in a way that allows easy querying (filter by region, category, calendar type).
   * Decide whether you’ll use a **REST API** or consider **GraphQL** if flexibility in querying is needed later on.
3. **Backend Technology Stack**

   * **Node.js** with **Express** for the API server.
   * **MongoDB** (or PostgreSQL) for storing events.
   * Use **Cloud Functions** (like Firebase or AWS Lambda) for calculating and sending notifications based on dynamic events.
4. **Frontend Design**

   * **UI/UX design** for a simple dashboard (event calendar, notifications, business recommendations).
   * Use **React.js** (or Next.js for SEO benefits) to build a PWA initially.
   * Include features like **push notifications** for event reminders, event previews, and recommendations.
5. **Notification Service**

   Integrate **Firebase Cloud Messaging** or **OneSignal** for push notifications.

#### **Phase 3: Development**

1. **Set Up the Database**

   Create your MongoDB collections or PostgreSQL tables to store event data. Use migration tools like **Knex.js** for PostgreSQL if needed.
2. **Build the Backend API**

   Start with the basic REST endpoints:

   * **GET /events** : Retrieve all events.
   * **GET /events/today** : Retrieve events happening today.
   * **GET /events/lunar** : Retrieve lunar-based events.
   * **GET /events/recommendations** : Business-specific recommendations.
   * **POST /events** : Add new seasonal events.
3. **Implement Event Calculation Logic**

   Integrate the necessary APIs for calculating **lunar events** (Islamic, Malayalam calendar) and hard-code  **fixed-date events** .
4. **Build the Frontend (PWA)**

   Create the basic app:

   * Display events in a calendar format.
   * Integrate push notifications (Firebase).
   * Set up a simple dashboard for business owners to get event alerts.

#### **Phase 4: Testing & Deployment**

1. **Test the APIs**

   * Test your endpoints with Postman or Swagger.
   * Write unit and integration tests for backend functionality.
2. **Test Frontend (PWA)**

   * Ensure that the app works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop.
   * Make sure notifications work in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
3. **Deploy Backend & Frontend**

   * Use  **Heroku** ,  **Vercel** , or **Netlify** for easy deployment of the backend and frontend.
   * Set up **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) for automated deployments.
4. **Monitoring & Analytics**

   Set up **Google Analytics** or **Mixpanel** to track user activity and event engagement.

#### **Phase 5: Marketing & Scaling**

1. **Launch MVP**

   Release the minimum viable product (MVP) to get early feedback. Start with a **small local target** (Kerala region) and gather insights.
2. **Reach Out to Potential Users**

   * Start with  **local businesses** : clothing stores, grocery shops, event planners.
   * Create a **website** with a sign-up form for early access.
   * Run **targeted ads** on social media to reach regional retailers.
3. **User Feedback & Iteration**

   Collect feedback and iterate on features.

   * Add more events based on user demand.
   * Enhance notification frequency and customization options.
4. **Long-Term Growth**

   * Integrate more  **calendar types** : Add regional festivals, global events, etc.
   * Expand to a **native app** using **Flutter** or  **React Native** .
   * Build partnerships with **local event organizers** and  **business owners** .

### **To Start, Here’s What You Can Do:**

1. **Set Up the Project Repository**

   * GitHub or GitLab repo for version control.
   * Create a `README.md` with the project plan, technologies, and roadmap.
2. **Get APIs Integrated**

   Begin integrating **Aladhan API** (for Islamic holidays) and any available regional API for Malayalam dates.
3. **Frontend Skeleton**

   Start building a basic UI for the PWA, with event lists and a calendar component.
4. **Backend API Development**

   Set up your basic API in **Node.js** and start with the static events for testing.
